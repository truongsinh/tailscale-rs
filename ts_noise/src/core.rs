//! Supporting machinery for executing Noise handshakes.
//!
//! This is not a general-purpose Noise protocol library. The provided functionality is
//! sufficient to execute the two protocols that Tailscale cares about (IK and IKpsk2).
//!
//! This module only provides the primitive operations found in Noise handshakes. It is
//! the caller's responsibility to chain the primitives together correctly to produce the
//! desired handshake pattern.
//!
//! This module uses typestates to make some invalid sequences of operations compile-time
//! errors, in an effort to make protocol construction errors more obvious. This does not
//! cover all possible invalid sequences, it is still the caller's responsibility to ensure
//! that their sequence correctly reflects the desired handshake pattern.
