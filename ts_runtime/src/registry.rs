///
/// When you communicate with this registry, you always explicitly name the type of actor you're
/// talking about as well as the user-provided string name. This is an affordance for type-safety;
/// kameo doesn't support fully type-erased actor references or message handlers. As a consequence,
/// names are permitted to overlap between actors of different types, as there can't be a collision
/// between them.
///
/// The conventional structure of names in this registry includes the idea of a "canonical" actor
/// which is unique. For actors expected to run as singletons or to have a single special instance,
/// the `new` function on any of the message types addresses this canonical instance. The canonical
/// name isn't privileged in any other way (e.g. the registry doesn't prevent you from spawning
/// named actors if there's a canonical one), it's just a conventional, easily-addressed name for a
/// special actor if you have one.
///
/// # Liveness
///
/// This registry does not keep actors alive; all refs are held weakly.
///
/// # Comparison to [`kameo::registry`]
///
/// We're not using the singleton [`kameo::registry::ACTOR_REGISTRY`] because it's at global scope,
/// but we need naming services to be scoped to each instance of a tailscale runtime. Rather than
/// dealing with namespace prefixes, we just run a per-runtime registry.
///
/// We don't use [`kameo::registry::ActorRegistry`] for the per-runtime registry because it doesn't
/// have any built-in synchronization, is hard to customize, and requires manual downcasting on the
/// part of the user, despite the fact that the contained actor refs are only usable if you know
/// what kind of messages they can handle (i.e. you essentially must know the actor type a priori).
